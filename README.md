# Amiga emulator for MinUI / NextUI

This release is for the TrimUI Brick.
It hasn't been tested on anything else.

Extract the content of the ZIP file at the root of your SD card.

Once done, add your games to the Roms folder, using the *PUAE* tag, for instance, create a folder named *Roms/Amiga (PUAE)*.
You should mainly use WHDLoad games, rather than ADF ones, as it largely eases the usage of multi-disk games.

You can bring up the keyboard by pressing *start*.

The TrimUI Brick is a very nice machine, but keep your expectations low regarding Amiga emulation. Some games won't run at full speed.

_Note_: this emulator requires NextUI version 2.6.3 or higher.
