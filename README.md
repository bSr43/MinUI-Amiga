Once done, add your games to the Roms folder, using the *PUAE* tag, for instance, create a folder named *Roms/Amiga (PUAE)*.
You should mainly use WHDLoad games, rather than ADF ones, as it largely eases the usage of multi-disk games.

You can bring up the keyboard by pressing *start*.

The TrimUI Brick is a very nice machine, but keep your expectations low regarding Amiga emulation. Some games won't run at full speed.

_Note_: this emulator requires NextUI version 2.6.3 or higher.
